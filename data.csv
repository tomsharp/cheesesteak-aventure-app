I liked the roll very much but it had a complete failure under the stress of the barbecue sauce. The meat was good but at $9 it needed a lot more. I guess I can't complain about it being a messy sandwich at an outdoor event with no bathrooms for me to wash my hands when I could have ordered a less messy sandwich.

Everything had a nice taste and made with love.

What I don't like about these kinds of sandwiches, a very good steak on a roll, is that you're guaranteed at least one bad bite.

Was it a party in that roll or a train wreck? The only flavor that really stood out was of a canned mushroom. In my humble opinion, when you have that much stuff together it needs to spend time on the grill together cooking and blending and mixing flavor so you have some kind of uniform taste.
